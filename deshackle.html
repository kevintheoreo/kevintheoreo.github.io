        <h2 class="py-3">How I chose this project</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Growing up, social anxiety was one of the factors that crippled my ability to live the life that I
            want. This included the ability to make friends, communicate with teachers which not only made me
            unhappy due to the fact that I lack social interaction but also resulted in me lacking the resources I
            need to study productively and grow as a person. Over the years, I managed to tackle this problem to
            an extent through experimentation but that left me wondering about the people who had it worse than
            me, considering that mine was just mild social anxiety. I found out that one of the largest mental
            healthcare problem in the world is Social Anxiety Disorder and should be taken seriously as it affects
            all areas of a person’s life. Despite its significance, there are still no concrete solutions to solve it and
            thus I would like to research on this area and possibly come up with a product that could help
            overcome the problem of Social Anxiety Disorder.

        <h2 class="py-3">Aim of Project</h2>
        <div>
          <p>The aim of my project was to create an android application that could help replace current treatments
           for Social Anxiety Disorder(SAD). This treatments include Cognitive Behaviour Therapy(CBT) sessions, medication
          Graded Self-exposure, etc. All of these treatment methods comes with its pros and cons, thus I would combine elements
         of the current treatment methods together with gamification and the convenience of smartphone technology to help users.</p>

        <h2 class="py-3">What my application does</h2>
        <div>
          <p>The Deshackle app generates a list of social challenges for the user depending on what level they have set for themselves.
           When user selects a challenge, they are given the choice to Defeat, Call An Ally or Forfeit. By selecting defeat, they can
          submit a tip into the database on how they managed to finish the challenge. If users select Call An Ally, they can retrieve a
        randomly generated tip given by other users for that challenge. When user selects forfeit, they give up the challenge. By completing
       challenges, users can earn points which can be used to make in-app purchases such as downloadable wallpapers. There is also a feature called
      training grounds which is a bunch of self-help articles that help users gain confidence in completing the challenges.</p>
          <p style="font-style:italic">Example of challenges:</p>
          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">Level 1: Practice good posture, head up, shoulders back. Walk slowly and purposefully.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Level 2: Speak with a person you see often. (E.g. Receptionist at work)</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Level 2: Call up a company and make enquiries.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Level 3: Go to a "meet-up" group on your own and talk to people.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="py-3">Database Structure</h2>
          <div>
            <p>I needed a database to store the challenge tips that users submit and retrieve.
             The database that I chose is Firebase's Cloud Firestore. This is a flexible and
             scalable NoSQL cloud database. Cloud Firestore data model can consist of only collections and documents where collections
             are a group of documents. Documents can contain as many fields which are key-pair values and these
             values can contain basic data types such as Strings, Integers, Booleans and Arrays. However each
             document can only hold up to 1MB of data. Another feature of documents is that it can also be linked
             to another collection. This means that nested collections can be made to store more documents under a
             document. For my project, I would need a collection to store “Challenge” documents which will hold the
             field “challengeName: String” which is the challenge String display that users will see. For storing
             “Tips”, I can either store it as a String array within the “Challenge” document, or I can create a new
             collection called “Tips” and link it to the “Challenge” document. Since each document can only hold up
             to 1MB of data, I will not store as String array as it might present a problem when there are multiple
             users which in turn lead to many tips being created that might hit the size limit. In order to prevent this, I
             created a “Tips” collection under the “Challenge” document. This means that for each “Challenge”
             document, it is linked to a collection of “Tip” documents for that challenge which users can created in
             the application. This “Tip” document will have the field “tipName: String” which is the String that users
             store in Defeat activity or retrieve in Call Ally activity.
